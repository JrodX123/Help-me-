# Help-me-
I go to Sky factory 2 which is from the AT launcher and I try to create a server and when i have clicked the button on the AT launcher to actually create the server I go in my folder (where I keep AT launcher) and I click servers then I click Sky factory then finally I click Launchserver.bat, when I click on this it opens this thing called "C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe opens and eventually it loads a lot of stuff but what do i do after that because it just stops loading when it says "unloading dimension" but usually it says press any key to continue then when I click any key it goes off so someone please help me create a server for sky factory 2 for me and my friend...
